# api_project


In this project I will analyze conversations form a chat messaging app (like slack or whatsapp). The purpose of the analysis is to extract
sentiment metrics people interactions. We are going to create an api service for this purpose. In our current case, the chat service will call our api
endpoints and it's our task to create those endpoints for:

- A) Store the data in a `mongodb` database
- B) Do the analysis of the data inside `mongodb`

You will practice in this project:

- Create an API using `flask`
- Use `pymongo` insert methods
- NLTK sentiment analysis
- Docker, Heroku and Cloud databases
- Recommender systems
