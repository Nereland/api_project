Rafiki;We would like to take a few moments to get you acquainted with the story of Simba.,,
Scar;Why! If it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners. 
Mufasa;Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
Scar;That was today? Oh, I feel simply awful. 
Scar;Must have slipped my mind.
Zazu; Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should have been first 
Scar;Well, I was first in line... until the little hairball was born.
Mufasa;That “hairball” is my son -and your future king.
Scar;Ohh, I shall practice my curtsy.
Mufasa;Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Scar;On, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
Mufasa;Is that a challenge? 
Scar;Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Zazu;Pity! Why not? 
Scar;Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share. But, when it comes to brute strength..I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
Zazu;here's one in every family sire... Two in mine actually. And they always
Simba;Simba: Yeah! ,,
Mufasa;Look Simba.,,Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
Mufasa;A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day Simba, the sun will set on my,,
Simba;And this’ll all be mine? ,,
Mufasa;Everything. ,,
Simba;Everything the light touches. What about that shadowy place?
Mufasa;"That's beyond our borders; you must never go there, Simba.,"
Simba;But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.,
Mufasa;Oh, there's more to being king than-- getting your way all the time.,
Simba;There's more? ,
Mufasa;Everything you see exists together, in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand,the balance, and have respect all the creatures-- from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.,
Simba; But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?,
Mufasa;Yes, Simba, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies become the grass. And the, antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great Circle of Life. ,
Simba;All right, it worked! ,,,,,
Nala;We lost 'im. I told you we would. He’s a dodo.,,,,,
Simba;I ... am a genius.,,,,,
Nala;Hey, Genius, it was my idea.,,,,,
Simba;Yeah, but I pulled it off. ,,,,,
Simba;This is it.... We made it.,,,,,
Nala;It's really creepy. ,
Simba;Yeah... isn't it great?,
Nala;We could get in big trouble.,
Simba;I know, huh.,
Nala;I wonder if its brains are still in there. ,
Simba;There's only one way to know. Come on. Let’s go check it out.,
Zazu;The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here.,
Simba;Aw, man. ,
Nala;Busted! 
Zazu; We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.,
